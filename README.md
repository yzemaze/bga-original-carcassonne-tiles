# Original Carcassonne Tiles for Board Game Arena

A [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script that displays the original/old-style tiles while playing [Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne) at [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com).

### Aren't the original tiles available at the site?

Yes, but some of them are missing.

When the Princess and Dragons extension was added to the website, Board Game Arena included support to play the game with either the original/old-style tiles or the newer tiles with the blue roofs. However, they were unable to include the old-style tiles for the Princess and Dragons extension.

**This script brings those missing tiles to the game together with some small improved graphics.**

It works for replays, too!

### How do I use the script?

1. Make sure that you have the Tampermonkey extension installed on your web browser.
2. Open the raw [bga-original-carcassonne-tiles.user.js file](https://github.com/bockbilbo/bga-original-carcassonne-tiles/raw/master/bga-original-carcassonne-tiles.user.js).
3. The TamperMonkey UserScript Installation page will automatically open.
4. Click "Install" to install the script in your browser.
5. Go to [boardgamearena.com](https://boardgamearena.com) and start a Carcassonne game.
6. Click on the game settings menu located at the top-right corner.
7. Select "latest" under "Artwork edition.
8. Have fun!

### Does the script disable the new-style tiles from the game?

Yes. When the script is active, the website acts as if it was using the new-style tiles while in reality it uses the original tiles from an image stored in this repository.

If you want to use the new-style tiles after having installed the script, you will need to disable or uninstall it.

### How do I uninstall/disable the script?

Do a quick search online. Scripts can be uninstalled and disabled from the Tampermonkey extension dashboard.
